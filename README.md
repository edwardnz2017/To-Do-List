This is a to do list. 

You first will create a new project, such as 'School' or 'Work' and then once you've clicked on the project, you can add or delete new or existing tasks respectively.

This was very challenging for me as I struggled dealing with a multi-dimensional arrays.

I also tried to keep all my modules neat with everything coded using the module patterns design.

Please let me know if you have any feedback!
